# Gait timing
frequency_hz: 0.7        # Gait frequency (Session 30: optimal in 0.5-0.8 sweep)
duty_cycle: 0.6          # 60% stance, 40% swing

# Leg trajectory angles (radians)
# Session 34: BACKLASH-TOLERANT AMPLITUDES
# Hardware has ~30° backlash on direction reversal. All motions must exceed this.
# Old calf: -1.35 to -0.90 = 26° (absorbed by backlash)
# New calf: -1.38 to -0.50 = 50° (exceeds backlash with 20° margin)
trajectory:
  swing_thigh: 0.25      # Session 34: More back during swing (was 0.40)

  stance_calf: -0.50     # Session 34: More extended during stance (was -0.90)
  swing_calf: -1.38      # Session 34: Close to limit (was -1.35)

# Control loop
control:

  action_filter_beta: 0.40  # Session 35: Optimal (0.50 too strong, 0.35 OK but 0.40 best)

# Joint action ranges (for scaling policy output)
joint_range:
  shoulder: 0.30         # ±0.30 rad from default
  thigh: 0.90            # ±0.90 rad from default
  calf: 0.90             # ±0.90 rad from default

# Default joint positions - TWO CONVENTIONS
# Hardware convention: what the servo encoders read at rest
# RL convention: what the simulation training used
# The relationship: hw = hw_default + (rl - rl_default) * joint_sign

# Hardware default pose (servo encoder readings at athletic stance)
hw_default_pose:
  shoulders: 0.0         # All shoulders at 0 rad
  thighs: 0.3            # All thighs at 0.3 rad
  calves: -0.75          # All calves at -0.75 rad

# RL default pose (simulation training convention)
# NOTE: Shoulders alternate for diagonal trot gait
rl_default_pose:
  shoulder_fl: 0.20      # FL shoulder: +0.20 rad
  shoulder_fr: -0.20     # FR shoulder: -0.20 rad

# Joint sign for convention conversion (RL <-> Hardware)
# Multiply relative positions by this to convert: rl_rel = hw_rel * joint_sign
