# Gait timing
frequency_hz: 0.7        # Gait frequency (Session 30: optimal in 0.5-0.8 sweep)
duty_cycle: 0.6          # 60% stance, 40% swing

# Leg trajectory angles (radians)
trajectory:
  swing_thigh: 0.40      # Thigh angle during swing phase
  stance_thigh: 0.90     # Thigh angle during stance phase
  stance_calf: -0.90     # Calf angle during stance phase
  swing_calf: -1.35      # Calf angle during swing phase (Session 30: margin from limit)
  shoulder_amplitude: 0.05  # Shoulder oscillation amplitude

# Residual learning
residual_scale: 0.05     # Policy output multiplier (Session 30: 0.08 regressed)

# Control loop
control:
  rate_hz: 20            # Control frequency (50ms period)
  action_filter_beta: 0.18  # EMA filter coefficient

# Joint action ranges (for scaling policy output)
joint_range:
