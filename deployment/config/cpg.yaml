# Gait timing
frequency_hz: 0.5        # Gait frequency (2 second cycle)
duty_cycle: 0.6          # 60% stance, 40% swing

# Leg trajectory angles (radians)
trajectory:
  swing_thigh: 0.40      # Thigh angle during swing phase
  stance_thigh: 0.90     # Thigh angle during stance phase
  stance_calf: -0.90     # Calf angle during stance phase
  swing_calf: -1.40      # Calf angle during swing phase
  shoulder_amplitude: 0.05  # Shoulder oscillation amplitude

# Residual learning
residual_scale: 0.05     # Policy output multiplier (very conservative)

# Control loop
control:
  rate_hz: 20            # Control frequency (50ms period)
  action_filter_beta: 0.18  # EMA filter coefficient

# Joint action ranges (for scaling policy output)
joint_range:
  shoulder: 0.30         # ±0.30 rad from default
  thigh: 0.90            # ±0.90 rad from default
  calf: 0.90             # ±0.90 rad from default

# Default joint positions (athletic stance)
default_pose:
  shoulders: 0.0         # All shoulders at 0 rad
  thighs: 0.3            # All thighs at 0.3 rad
  calves: -0.75          # All calves at -0.75 rad
