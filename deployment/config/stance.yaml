# Harold canonical stance (single source of truth)
version: 1
units:
  angle: rad

# Joint order for 12D arrays:
# [shoulders FL, FR, BL, BR, thighs FL, FR, BL, BR, calves FL, FR, BL, BR]
joint_order:
  - shoulder_fl
  - shoulder_fr
  - shoulder_bl
  - shoulder_br
  - thigh_fl
  - thigh_fr
  - thigh_bl
  - thigh_br
  - calf_fl
  - calf_fr
  - calf_bl
  - calf_br

# Hardware convention: servo encoder readings at ready stance.
hw_default_pose:
  shoulders: 0.0
  thighs: 0.65
  calves: -1.13

# RL convention: simulation default pose (matches ready stance).
rl_default_pose:
  shoulder_fl: 0.0
  shoulder_fr: 0.0
  shoulder_bl: 0.0
  shoulder_br: 0.0
  thighs: 0.65
  calves: -1.13

notes:
  - Canonical ready stance for hardware and simulation (aka athletic/crouched in older notes).
  - Firmware DEFAULT_POSE should be kept in sync with hw_default_pose.
