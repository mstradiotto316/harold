# Memory Archives Index

These archives keep `docs/memory/OBSERVATIONS.md` concise. Only read archives when you need historical context or to trace an older regression.

## How to Use
- Default: read `docs/memory/OBSERVATIONS.md` only.
- If you need older details, open the smallest relevant archive below.
- Avoid loading multiple archives unless necessary.

## Current Archives
- `docs/memory/archives/OBSERVATIONS_2026-01-04_full.md` - Full historical observations through 2026-01-04 (legacy content moved from OBSERVATIONS.md).

## Archival Rule (Going Forward)
When `OBSERVATIONS.md` grows beyond ~200-300 lines or spans more than 2 weeks, move older sections into a new archive file named:
- `OBSERVATIONS_YYYY_MM.md` (monthly), or
- `OBSERVATIONS_YYYY_QX.md` (quarterly)
Then add the new file here with a one-line scope note.
