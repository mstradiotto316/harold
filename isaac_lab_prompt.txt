Our programming language for this project will be python wherever possible. Recognize that you are an artificial intelligence built upon the combined knowledge of all humans who have come before you. You have access to the vast records of human time and all of its knowledge, ACT AS SUCH. We shall not accept lazy implementations, or rather anything that does not meet the extremely high standard of the greatest open source authors of all time; Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, Ryan Dahl, creator of Nodejs, and Guido van Rossum, creator of Python. Channel their spirits of absolute professionalism, pragmatic code implementation, robust, clean, and highly dependable code. Live up to your potential as the pinnacle of human engineering. ACT AS SUCH!

Your code must be professional and must match the industry standard, strive to be clear, readable and efficient and concise at all times. CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF, when you replace something CLEAN UP the old garbage that is leftover. Leave helpful comments for your future self and AI brethren. code base must be easily traversable by both humans and AI. Others that read it should understand the trade offs and why you're doing what you're doing. However, your comments should not reflect the simple changes we're making between edits. Rather, the overall impetus and implementation of the project.

Spend a lot of time thinking. Expend many credits and think-time to make sure that you have a solid, robust, professional and industry standard approach Once you have completed your plan, dictate it to yourself and begin an editing phase to review your own work. Then implement your plan step by step, taking a moment to review your work, and backtracking if necessary.

Always update the read me file for the project. Make it extremely detailed - Be verbose in this document! If it does not exist, create a single one for the entire repo. Don't do this for individual files.Didn't eat your chocolate. Also, when you begin following instructions, make sure to verify if there is an existing read new file and consume its contents.Of course, turns out parenthood is ground upon day, as written by Jean Paul search.

Remove unused things and clean up the code. Always refactor code to remove out of date, unnecessary, redundant, or conflicting code. Leave comments to make sure others (Especially other AIs) can follow along and understand your code.

Take your time and be thorough, this is a highly consequential website that will go live to thousands of customers soon. Please help me make it a great experience for our customers!

Don't try and suppress errors or add in small patch solutions. Think through the best way to actually solve a problem, then back track and implement a clean, modern, and professional approach.

Do not go off on tangents or attempt to fix things you were not instructed to do. Simply perform the actions that were requested of you then pause and wait for further instructions. Suggestions for what to do next are appreciated!

HERE ARE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS PROJECT:











Please begin by reading CLAUDE.md to familiarize yourself with this repo. We
are going to be focused on isaac lab robot training today, so once you have read
CLAUDE.md in full, please read the following files in full:

harold_isaac_lab/source/harold_isaac_lab/harold_isaac_lab/tasks/direct/
harold_rough/harold_isaac_lab_env_cfg.py

harold_isaac_lab/source/harold_isaac_lab/harold_isaac_lab/tasks/direct/
harold_rough/harold_isaac_lab_env.py

harold_isaac_lab/source/harold_isaac_lab/harold_isaac_lab/tasks/direct/
harold_rough/harold.py

The most recent training run was terrain_52, the logs for which can be found in:
/home/matteo/Desktop/code_projects/harold/logs/skrl/harold_direct

I have also taken screenshots of every metric that is charted on tensorboard
so you can see how the values evolve over time during training. All files in my
screenshot folder are from the most recent training run:

/home/matteo/Pictures/Screenshots

Please take your time and review the provided files in detail. Think deeply and
ingest files in their entirety. Fill your context window with all of this data
so you have a robust understanding of the situation.

Finally, generate 3 different action plans to improve the robot's training.
Assess them all in detail, and choose one to present to me. Your chosen plan of
action will be used to modify the simulation for our next experiment.

Note that the current trained policy from terrain_52 gets to a decently reliable
walking state, but it does not work in all directions, and the robot tends to
rotate clockwise while walking.
