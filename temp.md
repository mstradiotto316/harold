Please begin by reading the AGENTS.md file.

We are going to work on deploying the most recently trained policy found in /home/matteo/Desktop/code_projects/harold/logs/skrl/harold_direct/terrain_64_2 to the real world robot.

To see how the real world robot works, please reference the /home/matteo/Desktop/code_projects/harold/firmware/PushupTestWithFeedback file.

Your job is to build a down to earth, well thought out plan for deploying the trained policy to the real world robot. We will take small, verifiable steps as we move through the plan, being careful not to bite off more than we can chew with each step. This is a high stakes operation, and will determine the future of my fledgling robotics company, please treat this task with the appropriate care and seriousness as it is extremely important to me.
